/*
Sample Problem 2: Vehicle Management System with Hybrid Inheritance
Description: Model a vehicle system where Vehicle is the superclass and ElectricVehicle and PetrolVehicle are subclasses. Additionally, create a Refuelable interface implemented by PetrolVehicle.
Tasks:



Goal: Use hybrid inheritance by having PetrolVehicle implement both Vehicle and Refuelable, demonstrating how Java interfaces allow adding multiple behaviors.
