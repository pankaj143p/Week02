/*
Sample Problem 1: Restaurant Management System with Hybrid Inheritance
Description: Model a restaurant system where Person is the superclass and Chef and Waiter are subclasses. Both Chef and Waiter should implement a Worker interface that requires a performDuties() method.
Tasks:



Goal: Practice hybrid inheritance by combining inheritance and interfaces, giving multiple behaviors to the same objects.
